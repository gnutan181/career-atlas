## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks

1. **OAuth-Only Authentication Lock:** The onboarding flow relies _exclusively_ on Google OAuth. Automated e2e tests (like TestSprite) and users without Google cannot access or interact with any feature, rendering the entire app blocked for generic testing.
2. **InsForge SDK Client Error:** Multiple core dashboard pages report a severe runtime exception: `insforge.auth.getSession is not a function`. The method invoked in the TanStack queries or the Auth Provider is incorrect or deprecated, completely bricking the authenticated dashboard.
3. **Missing UI Fallback Controls:** Navigating to standalone pages (e.g. `/profile` directly or `/roadmap`) without full backend seeding puts the user in a dead state. There are no "Upload Resume", "Generate Roadmap", or fallback buttons present in the dashboards themselves.
4. **Infinite Loading States:** Several endpoints get permanently stuck in an empty loading state when querying missing data instead of gracefully degrading to empty states.
